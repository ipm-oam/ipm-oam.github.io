The importance of using fast and automatic methods to classify variable stars for large amounts of data is undeniable. There have been many attempts to classify variable stars by traditional algorithms like Random Forest. In recent years, neural networks as classifiers have come to notice. This paper uses the Hierarchical Classification technique, which contains several models with same network structure. Our pre-processing method uses light curves and period of stars as input data. We consider most of the classes and subclasses of variable stars in OGLE-IV database and show that using Hierarchical Classification technique and designing appropriate preprocessing can increase accuracy of predicting smaller classes. We obtain an accuracy of 98% for class classification and 93% for subclasses classification.
