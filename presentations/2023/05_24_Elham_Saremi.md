### Astronomical data analysis with GNU Astronomy Utilities (Gnuastro)
#### Elham Saremi (Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias)
**24 May 2023**

---

Gnuastro is an official GNU package of a large collection of programs to enable easy, robust, and most importantly fast and efficient, data analysis directly on the command-line. In this session, I will introduce you to the useful capabilities of many of the programs in Gnuastro. We will have a hands-on Gnuastro experience. So please install it before Wednesday.

Due to its [few dependencies](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuastro/manual/html_node/Mandatory-dependencies.html), Gnuastro can be easily installed from source on macOS or GNU/Linux operating systems (Please see: [Quick start](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuastro/manual/html_node/Quick-start.html)). 
For a fast trial, you can also use Conda (which will download pre-built binaries and thus be much faster).
conda create -n gnuastro -c conda-forge gnuastro
conda activate gnuastro
Also, you will need TOPCAT and DS9 programs.
