Sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy (SagDIG) is an isolated galaxy with low metallicity and high gas content in the Local Group. Like many dwarf irregular galaxies, SagDIG has had continuous star formation activity across its lifetime, though with different rates, and has experienced an enhancement of star formation since z ≃ 1. Its features make it an ideal target for many studies concerning the origin and evolution of dwarf galaxies. As a part of the Isaac Newton Telescope monitoring survey of LG dwarf galaxies, we studied this galaxy through its long-period variable stars (LPVs), namely, asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs) and red supergiant stars. We employed (Javadi et al. 2011b) method, which relies on evaluating the relation between the luminosity and birth mass of LPVs to derive the star formation history (SFH) of SagDIG.
