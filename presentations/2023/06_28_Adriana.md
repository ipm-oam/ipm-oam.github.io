### How to be expressive. Preparing and delivering specialised scientific talks.
#### Adriana de Lorenzo-Cáceres Rodríguez (Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias)
**28 June 2023**

---

We all have attended a great number of conferences and seminars and, beyond our interest in the scientific topic,
we have quickly identified talks that we rate as “(very) good” and talks that we absolutely do not like. Sometimes
it is the speaker who cannot make her/his message reach us, sometimes the slides do not help understand the context.
However, it is not easy to isolate the reasons of such failure and avoid them when we prepare our own talks. I will
try to put into words common mistakes the majority of researchers make in scientific presentations, with the hope that
this simple (but extremely hard) exercise helps us realise about them when preparing or delivering our scientific talks.
