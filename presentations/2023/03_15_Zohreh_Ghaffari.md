### SHARKS II. Optimising a near−infrared imaging survey for low surface brightness science

There has been extraordinary progress in the study of the low surface brightness Universe in the 
optical range, but much less so from near-infrared (NIR) imaging surveys. We present an observing 
and data analysis pipeline for the SHARKS survey using the 4 m VISTA telescope, designed to preserve 
the faint light in galaxy outskirts. We place particular emphasis on the sky subtraction. We use new 
Ks -band imaging of the Virgo grand-design spiral galaxy NGC 4030 to illustrate the results of our 
pipeline, which creates a sky flat-field, removes the true sky representation at the observation time, 
and then uses weighted co-adds to remove spurious detections. Using the images and radial profiles,
we show how we recover most of the NIR emission from the outskirts of this large galaxy which was 
missing from the previous more standard reduction methods. We quantify the differences between the 
standard and new reduction procedures, and outline how the new method can be used across the SHARKS 
survey. The shell disclosed the NGC 4030 in our reduction increases significantly the total reported 
stellar mass by 50%. The new prominent structure that reveals better the morphology thus improves the 
stellar mass measurements which is one of the goals of the NIR observations.
