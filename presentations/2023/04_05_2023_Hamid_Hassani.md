### PHANGS-JWST First Results ApJ Letters Focus Issue
#### Hamid Hassani (University of Alberta)
**1 March 2023**

JWST is transforming astrophysics, particularly in the study of early star formation and the interstellar medium (ISM), through mid-infrared observations 
that can penetrate the dust that blocks visible light. With its sensitivity and resolution, JWST is enabling observation of young sources and the ISM 
beyond the Local Group, providing new insights into the star formation cycle and informing theoretical models. This Focus Issue presents the first results
from the PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1 Treasury survey, which combines panchromatic observations with theoretical models to study galaxy evolution, star formation, 
and feedback. The initial set of papers highlights the promise of JWST's capabilities for understanding dust, gas, star formation, and feedback in full 
galactic context, with results ranging from embedded star clusters to feedback-driven bubbles and shells. With imaging of 19 galaxies, the PHANGS-JWST 
program promises to accelerate discovery in these fields.
