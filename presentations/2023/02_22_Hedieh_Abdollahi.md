We reconstruct the star formation history (SFH) of And IX, one of the metal-poor dwarf spheroidal satellites of M 31 and closest to the host by probing
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. AGBs are handy tracers of the SFH because they are easy to detect due to their long-period variability in luminosity. 
We identify 50 LPVs through the photometry of resolved stars in And IX using the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) in two filters, Sloan i' and Harris V. By 
employing the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting for observed LPVs in And IX, we evaluate the total mass-loss rate about 0.00024 M_sun/yr from the
C- and O-rich type of dust-enshrouded LPVs. Our findings suggest an outside-in galaxy formation scenario for And IX with a quenching occurring 3.8 Gyr ago.
