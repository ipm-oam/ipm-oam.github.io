### LaTeX to build professional documents
#### Sepideh Eskandarlou (Centro de Estudios de Física del Cosmos de Aragón)

LaTeX is a professional typesetting system to create a ready to print/publish (usually PDF!) document (usually papers!). LaTeX is the format used by arXiv, and many journals, when you want to submit your scientific papers. With LaTeX, you "program" the final document: text,
figures, tables, bibliography and etc, through a plain-text (source)
file. When you run LaTeX on your source, it will parse your LaTeX source
and find the best way to blend everything in a nice and professionally
design PDF document. Therefore LaTeX allows you to focus on the actual
content of your text, tables, plots, and not have to worry about the
final design (the "style" file provided by the journal will do all of
this for you automatically). This is in contrast to
"What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get" (or WYSIWYG) editors, like Microsoft Word
or LibreOffice Writer, which force you to worry about style in the
middle of content writing (which is very frustrating). Since the source
of a LaTeX document is plain-text, you can use version-control systems
like Git to keep track of your changes and updates. The aim of this 
session is to introduce LaTeX for those who are just starting to use it.
