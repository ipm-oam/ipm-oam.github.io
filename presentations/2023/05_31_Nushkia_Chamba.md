### Scientific Writing for Astronomers
#### Nushkia Chamba (Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias)
**31 May 2023**

---

While scientific writing is one of the main ways astronomers communicate their research to others, 
most researchers never receive any training to learn and develop this skill. In this short contribution, 
I summarise, distribute and discuss the material from a two-part guide on how to plan, write and publish 
a research paper in astronomy, freely available on Nature Astronomy (Part1: [https://rdcu.be/cVdtK](https://rdcu.be/cVdtK)  and 
Part 2: [https://rdcu.be/cVdtJ](https://rdcu.be/cVdtJ) ). I will particularly focus on how to craft a clear title, abstract and 
discuss practical tips on writing clear sentences and paragraphs, with examples you can try yourself. 
All authors, both first time writers and more experienced, are warmly welcome!
