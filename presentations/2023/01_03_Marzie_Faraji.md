### Inflation in Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity in Light of Planck2018
#### Marzie Faraji (IPM)
**3 Jan 2023**

---

We try to study the inflationary era by a model named Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG). In this model, the squared of the matter field’s energy-momentum tensor has been added to the Einstein–Hilbert action. In order to verify the theoretical results, planck2018 dataset was also used. The obtained results show that the EMSG model is an observationally viable model of inflation.
